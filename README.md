## Recipe Details

### Ingredients:

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda

5. Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
6. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
